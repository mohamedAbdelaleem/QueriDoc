# üìÑ QueriDoc

**QueriDoc** is an AI-powered document querying system built with Django and deployed serverlessly on AWS using [Zappa](https://github.com/zappa/Zappa). It allows users to upload a document and ask natural-language questions about its content. The responses are generated using Claude 3 Haiku through AWS Bedrock.

## Features

- Upload a document and ask a question about its content.
- Responses are context-aware and grounded in the uploaded document.
- Built with Django, deployed using [Zappa](https://github.com/zappa/Zappa) to AWS Lambda.
- Uses Claude 3 Haiku via AWS Bedrock to generate accurate answers.
- Scalable, serverless architecture with real-time logging via CloudWatch.

---

## AWS Tools Used

- **AWS Lambda**: Runs the backend logic in a serverless environment.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Routes user requests to the Lambda function.
- **AWS Bedrock**: Hosts Claude 3 Haiku, the model used to answer questions.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Used for logging and monitoring Lambda functions.

## Architecture of the Project

Below is the architecture diagram that shows how the system works:

![Architecture Diagram](./QuriDoc_Architecture.png)

1. The user submits a document and a question via the frontend.
2. **API Gateway** receives the request and triggers a **Lambda function**.
3. Lambda:
   - Extracts the document text,
   - Constructs a prompt using the user‚Äôs query,
   - Sends it to **Claude 3 Haiku** via **AWS Bedrock**.
4. The answer is returned through the API Gateway back to the user.
